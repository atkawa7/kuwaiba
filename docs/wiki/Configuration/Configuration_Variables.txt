====== Configuration Variables ======
Created Wednesday 13 February 2019

//Tools → Configuration → Configuration Variables//

The configuration variables are used to provide customized parameters to dashboard widgets, reports, sync providers and many other module components. The configuration variables are organized in pools, but the only relevant thing is their name, not where the aare located, that's why it must be unique. As a naming convention, a variable name has at least three sections separated by dots(.). The first one is the general category (general, widgets, sync, etc), the second is an identifier of the component that uses it (for example a dashboard widget called //SImpleMapDashboardWidget//). The last one is the actual name of the variable. This naming policy is not enforced, but it is highly recommended. Use a consistent format across variables to avoid confusion.
